# personalprojects

This repository serves to showcase some personal coding projects I've worked on. 

Since the projects here are solely for my own learning, some require personal keys/account information or certain dependencies, so please contact me if you are attempting to download and run the repository. 

Currently, projects are distributed into 2 buckets:

1. Python (data science/analytics): 
	- CitiBike_Analysis: Analyzes asymmetries in the NYC CitiBike network and recommends 20 stations to remove for cost cuts.
	- Airport_Vis: Develops an interactive visualization of airports across the US, and maps relationships and flight patterns among the airports.

2. Javascript (full stack app development):
	- eVote: Work in progress on a mobile voting app with a frontend in React Native and backend in MongoDB Atlas designed to electronically enhance local, state, and federal elections to increase voter turnout.
